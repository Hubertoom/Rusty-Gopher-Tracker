#  Rusty Gopher Tracker 

## About the project 
As anyone can behold, the Earth is flat. Have you ever seen any curves? <br />
So the conclusion is simple as straight as a bow.
NASA claims they launched the International Spaces Station along with <br/>
the Russian Federation and we can check its position. <br />
It's nonsense, but it doesn't mean that nothing is flying above us! <br/>
This is Rusty Gopher! <br/>
Now you can track his position, and believe in pancake Earth! <br/>
Enjoy!
